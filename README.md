This is a Java-adapted implementation for generating random numbers using the multiple recursive generation method. The MARGNormal class provides two methods: one for generating random numbers from a uniform distribution and another for generating random numbers from a normal distribution. Users can specify the parameters for both distributions—minimum and maximum values for the uniform distribution, and mean and standard deviation for the normal distribution.
